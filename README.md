# Cloud-Gateway Application

#Â Cloud-Gateway uses to route incoming requests </br>
    -  When you want to call a rest service , This application handle request and check authorization then routes to application which is contains incoming service path.</br>
    -  I used to route services using spring cloud.</br>
    -  I organize swagger to use single interface.
